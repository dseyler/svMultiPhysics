 * @brief Integrator class encapsulates the Newton iteration loop for time integration
 *
 * This class handles the nonlinear Newton iteration scheme for solving coupled
 * multi-physics equations in svMultiPhysics. It manages:
 * - Solution variables (Ag, Yg, Dg) at generalized-alpha time levels
 * - Newton iteration loop with convergence checking
 * - Linear system assembly and solve
 * - Boundary condition application
 * - Pseudo-transient continuation, when enabled: every step starts from rest,
 *   takes one Newton iteration, hands its update to a registered client and
 *   adapts the pseudo time step (see PseudoTransientContinuation.h)
 *
 * Related to GitHub issue #442: Encapsulate the Newton iteration in main.cpp
